# Flashrom
The main purpose of this project is to implement a flashmemory-based kickstart ROM substitute/switcher for the Commodore Amiga line of computers.
It may also serve as a general-purpose substitute for 27C400-style EEPROMs.

It is based around the 29F800 flash memory chip and is the same length as a 40 pin DIP EEPROM, but a little wider (22.9mm) due to the fact that the 29F800 chips I had in my desk drawer was in a SOP-44 package.
